# üó∫Ô∏è React Away Project Roadmap

Welcome to the roadmap of **React Away**, a fullstack React meta-framework.

## ‚úì | Milestones

- **dependency injection**: IoC container resolved in 2nd component argument 
- **function decorator**: adecorator for functions 
- **function extensions**: metadata to functions 
- **modular CSS**: fixed CSS modular import bug 
- **dual data biding**: two-way data binding design for React 
- **reactive forms**: dual binding for uncontrolled components submit 
- **directory routing**: static routing with zero conventions 
- **context globals**: env, ioc and own as new global contexts 
- **action binding**: form[action] as a serialized fetch request 
- **prefetched routing**: cached HTML routes in client-side
- **webapi folder**: RESTful API supported in /apis folder 
- **fallback routing**: retry not-found routing with upper route 
- **partial hydration**: JS hydration only in interactive content 
- **streaming SSR**: JSX is streamed with Suspense API support 
- **extended HTML**: HTML is extended with link[type=react] to embed
